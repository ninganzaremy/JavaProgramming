//To create a file in Java, you can use the createNewFile() method. This method returns a boolean value: true if the file was successfully created, and false if the file already exists. Note that the method is enclosed in a try...catch block. This is necessary because it throws an IOException if an error occurs (if the file cannot be created for some reason):

import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class CreateFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File myObj = new File("filename.txt");
            if (myObj.createNewFile()) {
                System.out.println("File created: " + myObj.getName());
            } else {
                System.out.println("File already exists.");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
